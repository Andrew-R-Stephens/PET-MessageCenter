	&lt;h1&gt;Achievement Get: 10k Users&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Today marks the point at which "Phasmophobia Evidence Tool" surpassed 10,000 active users! It's difficult to imagine so many of you, but I have each and every one of you to thank for this truly monumental achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whether you're a long standing user or a new user, I owe a huge debt of gratitude because P.E.T. truly would not be such a success without your support! Three cheers to all of you! Your support means everything to me.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Interactive Map has arrived!</title>
      <pubDate>Friday, 15 September 2023</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;h1&gt;The Map Viewer has been updated!&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Map Viwer is now interactive! It supports map/floor/room selection, room searches, room boundary visualization, and displays Fuse Boxes and Cursed Items! Go check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Due to the new feature being highly experimental, if you have any problems with it, please be sure to contact TritiumGamingStudiosDM@gmail.com.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Happy hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Preparing for announced game Updates</title>
      <pubDate>Friday, 3 February 2023</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;h1&gt;A new Phasmophobia update is underway!&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Phasmophobia will be releasing a new difficulty mode called "Insanity".&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;"Insanity" mode will reduce given evidence count by 1, meaning that most ghosts will only leave one evidence while the Mimic will most likely leave two (this is unconfirmed).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;PET has been reworked to assist users with this new Insanity mode! The changes will be released in the the next PET update shortly following the Phasmophobia update.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A new feature -- the Ghost Box -- will be available for Beta testing with this new update. The Ghost Box is a Text to Speech (TTS) voice bot which allows individuals to communicate with the ghost without having to speak into the microphone directly. After connecting your phone audio output to you system input, via Bluetooth or Auxiliary cables, you may use the Ghost Box to transmit voice prompts directly into the game. This is especially good for the mute or deaf community, or for users who need to maintain a quiet working environment! As this is a delicate feature, some issues may arise. To enable the Ghost Box, these conditions must be met: PET must be granted permission to access the device's Microphone, your device must have a Text to Speech voice package installed (your selected language may require a specific TTS voice package installed for proper pronounciations), and your volume must be turned on to hear the audio output.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Other changes, such as bug fixes and added functionality, have also been in development. Expect to see these changes in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;As always, Happy Hunting!&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>Quality of Life | Hotfixes</title>
      <pubDate>Tuesday, 16 July 2022</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;h1&gt;Information on the Hotfixes&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The most recent Hotfixes &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; resolve crashes which were caused by new features in the Quality of Life update.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I'd like to extend many apologies for the issues. They were caused by many problems which I was unable to fabricate through testing, as they were heavily bound to both internet connectivity performance, device performance, and the Android OS versions. As such, I'll be closely monitoring Live performance over the next few days for any new problems.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for submitting your user crash reports! Don't forget, you can join the PET Discord for more information, or to speak on issues directly!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h2&gt;As always, Happy Hunting!&lt;/h1&gt;

      <title>New App Update Inbound Soon!</title>
      <pubDate>Tuesday, 12 July 2022</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;p&gt;Quality of life improvements for P.E.T. are in the works!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A "swipe name to negate ghost" functionality is currently in its final stages. If a ghost name is swiped, it will be negated from the list of possible ghosts. Reswiping the name will remove the negation.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is very useful in certain circumstances, like negating a Wraith after finding footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;With the Nightmare mode selected, the Moroi will automatically be negated if the Spirit Box is left unselected after two evidence are already confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;To help you stay up-to-date, there will soon be Message Center notification icons to alert you of new messages and help you stay up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Other new features are planned for the end of Summer in seperate installments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Happy Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays, everyone! KineticGames has just released the new Christmas update!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The changelog contains new additions, including a new ghost called The Mimic as well as items which are called "Cursed Posessions".&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;(Please keep an eye out for new P.E.T. updates which should roll out very soon).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Be sure to visit the official Phasmophobia Discord for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tarot Cards!</title>
      <pubDate>Monday, 6 Dec 2021</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;h1&gt;A new "Cursed Posession"!&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;When Kinetic Games previously announced a new feature called "Cursed Posessions", we rightly speculated that the feature is meant solely to draw out activity from the ghost. The arsenal of Posessions originally included a Music Box and a Voodoo Doll. Pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Now that Tarot Cards have been announced as a new Cursed Posession, speculation about them has started. It seems like there will be an assortment of different cards that might be spawned in the map. Could it be that each type of card could cause the ghost to behave in a unique way? Time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be sure to visit the official Phasmophobia Discord for more information!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wednesday, 1 Dec 2021</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;h1&gt;Introducing Soon: The Mimic!&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Phasmophobia's Dev Team has announced a new Ghost type, "The Mimic".&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This ghost seems to copycat the behavior of other ghost types. More information in the form of a redacted Journal entry is provided in the official Phasmophobia Discord!&lt;/p&gt;
