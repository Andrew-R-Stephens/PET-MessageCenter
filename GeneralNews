        <title>Tarot Cards!</title>
        <pubDate>Monday, 6 Dec 2021</pubDate>
        <description>
	      &lt;h1&gt;A new "Cursed Posession"!&lt;/h1&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;When Kinetic Games previously announced a new feature called "Cursed Posessions", we rightly speculated that the feature is meant solely to draw out activity from the ghost. The arsenal of Posessions originally included a Music Box and a Voodoo Doll. Pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;Now that Tarot Cards have been announced as a new Cursed Posession, speculation about them has started. It seems like there will be an assortment of different cards that might be spawned in the map. Could it be that each type of card could cause the ghost to behave in a unique way? Time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;Be sure to visit the official Phasmophobia Discord for more information!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mimic announced!</title>

        <description>
	      &lt;h1&gt;Introducing Soon: The Mimic!&lt;/h1&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;Phasmophobia's Dev Team has announced a new Ghost type, "The Mimic".&lt;/p&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;This ghost seems to copycat the behavior of other ghost types. More information in the form of a redacted Journal entry is provided in the official Phasmophobia Discord!&lt;/p&gt;
