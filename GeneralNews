        <title>Another Cursed Posession announced: Tarot Cards!</title>
        <pubDate>Monday, 6 Dec 2021</pubDate>
        <description>
	      &lt;h1&gt;Introducing Soon: Tarot Cards!&lt;/h1&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;Kinetic Games recently announced a new feature called "Cursed Posessions". We assume this feature is meant solely to draw out activity from the ghost. Pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;It seems like there will be an assortment of different cards that might be spawned in the map. Could it be that each type of card could cause the ghost to behave in a unique way? Time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;Be sure to visit the official Phasmophobia Discord for more information!&lt;/p&gt;

	      &lt;h1&gt;Introducing Soon: The Mimic!&lt;/h1&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;Phasmophobia's Dev Team has announced a new Ghost type, "The Mimic".&lt;/p&gt;
	      &lt;p&gt;This ghost seems to copycat the behavior of other ghost types. More information in the form of a redacted Journal entry is provided in the official Phasmophobia Discord!&lt;/p&gt;
