      <title>New App Update Inbound Soon!</title>
      <pubDate>Tuesday, 12 July 2022</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;p&gt;Quality of life improvements for P.E.T. are in the works!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A "swipe name to negate ghost" functionality is currently in its final stages. If a ghost name is swiped, it will be negated from the list of possible ghosts. Reswiping the name will remove the negation.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is very useful in certain circumstances, like negating a Wraith after finding footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;With the Nightmare mode selected, the Moroi will automatically be negated if the Spirit Box is left unselected after two evidence are already confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;To help you stay up-to-date, there will soon be Message Center notification icons to alert you of new messages and help you stay up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Other new features are planned for the end of Summer in seperate installments.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Happy Hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tarot Cards!</title>
      <pubDate>Monday, 6 Dec 2021</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;h1&gt;A new "Cursed Posession"!&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;When Kinetic Games previously announced a new feature called "Cursed Posessions", we rightly speculated that the feature is meant solely to draw out activity from the ghost. The arsenal of Posessions originally included a Music Box and a Voodoo Doll. Pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Now that Tarot Cards have been announced as a new Cursed Posession, speculation about them has started. It seems like there will be an assortment of different cards that might be spawned in the map. Could it be that each type of card could cause the ghost to behave in a unique way? Time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Be sure to visit the official Phasmophobia Discord for more information!&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Wednesday, 1 Dec 2021</pubDate>
      <description>
	&lt;h1&gt;Introducing Soon: The Mimic!&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Phasmophobia's Dev Team has announced a new Ghost type, "The Mimic".&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This ghost seems to copycat the behavior of other ghost types. More information in the form of a redacted Journal entry is provided in the official Phasmophobia Discord!&lt;/p&gt;
